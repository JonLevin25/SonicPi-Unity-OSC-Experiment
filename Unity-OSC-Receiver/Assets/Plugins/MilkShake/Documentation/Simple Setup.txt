-------- Simple Setup --------
1) Setup your camera
	- Make sure that your camera is a child of an empty container GameObject, with its local position and rotation set to (0,0,0), otherwise the shaking will not work correctly.
	- You may need to move camera movement scripts off of the camera object and onto the container object.
	- Add a Shaker component to the camera by going to Add Component > MilkShake > Shaker.

2) Create a Shake Preset
	- Create a shake preset asset by going to Assets > Create > MilkShake > Shake Preset.

3) Shake the camera
	- Use the methods on the Shaker component to shake the camera.
	- Shake methods return a ShakeInstance (or populate a list of Shake Instances) which can be used to modify the shake after it has started.
