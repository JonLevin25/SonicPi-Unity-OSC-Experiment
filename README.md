# SonicPi-Unity-OSC-Experiment
An experiement playing around with OSC, Sonic Pi and Unity.
Made for the TAMI exhibition fundraiser

Prerequisites:
* Clone/download repo
* Open `Unity-OSC-Receiver` project in Unity 2020.3 (any 2020/2021 will *probably* work, older/newer not guarenteed)
* edit `sonic-pi-main.rb` so the line `#LIB_ROOT = <SONIC PI FOLDER>` has the address of the `Sonic-Pi-Code` folder
* Open Sonic Pi, load and run the `sonic-pi-main.rb` buffer

Running the four seasons demo:
1. clone repo
2. Open Unity project (tested with 2020.3)
3. 
Works with Unity 2020.3 running and the Sonic Pi buffer both running on localhost.

*Any bugs may be features, and any features are most definitely buggy :)*
